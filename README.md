# Wedding Website â€“ Front-End

This repository contains the development of the **React-based front-end** for the wedding website project, created as part of the Full Stack Web Development curriculum.

---

## Project Goals

- Develop a front-end application using **React**, with functional components, hooks, routing, and BEM-based styling.
- Implement the following views:
  - Landing Page (with redirect logic)
  - Home Page (with event details and countdown)
  - Our Story Page
  - Gallery Page
  - RSVP Page (with form and mock submission)
- Apply key concepts: JSX, hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, custom hook), routing with **React Router v6**.
- Use **mock data**, no backend integration required.
- Deploy the project using **Vercel** and optionally create a video walkthrough.
